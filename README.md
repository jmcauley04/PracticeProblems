# PracticeProblems

This project is just for reference - a list of problems for practice.

## Projects

PracticeProblems - This project holds the problems

ChallengeTests - This project allows the user to write their own tests, if desired

SolutionTests - This project stores the solution tests

## Terms

### Big O

Time - The upper bound of the time it takes to perform an algorithm

Space - the upper bound of how much memory it takes to perform an algorithm

O(1) - constant complexity; 1 represents any stable complexity

O(n) - proportionate complexity; the complexity increases proportionately with the size of the problem

O(n^2) - squared complexity; for every element in the problem, the complexity increases by the size of the problem

O(n^x) - x complexity; for every element in the problem, the complexity increases by the size of the problem to the (x-1) power.
