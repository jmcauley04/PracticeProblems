# PracticeProblems

This project is just for reference - a list of problems for practice.

## Projects

PracticeProblems - This project holds the problems

ChallengeTests - This project allows the user to write their own tests, if desired

SolutionTests - This project stores the solution tests

## Terms

### Big O

Time - The upper bound of the time it takes to perform an algorithm

Space - the upper bound of how much memory it takes to perform an algorithm

O(1) - constant complexity; 1 represents any stable complexity

O(n) - proportionate complexity; the complexity increases proportionately with the size of the problem

O(n^2) - squared complexity; for every element in the problem, the complexity increases by the size of the problem

O(n^x) - x complexity; for every element in the problem, the complexity increases by the size of the problem to the (x-1) power.


## Planned Problems

### Array and String

See source [structy]...

### Linked Lists

- Write a function, getNodeValue, that takes in the head of a linked list and an index. The function should return the value of the linked list at the specified index.
- Write a function, reverseList, that takes in the head of a linked list as an argument. The function should reverse the order of the nodes in the linked list in-place and return the new head of the reversed linked list.
- Write a function, zipperLists, that takes in the head of two linked lists as arguments. The function should zipper the two lists together into single linked list by alternating nodes. If one of the linked lists is longer than the other, the resulting list should terminate with the remaining nodes. The function should return the head of the zippered linked list.
	- Do this in-place, by mutating the original Nodes.
	- You may assume that both input lists are non-empty.
- Merge lists, is univalue list, longest streak, remove node, insert node, create linked list, add lists
