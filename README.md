# PracticeProblems

This project is just for reference - a list of problems for practice.

## Projects

- PracticeProblems - This project holds the problems
- ChallengeTests - This project allows the user to write their own tests, if desired
- SolutionTests - This project stores the solution tests

## Terms

### Big O

- Time - The upper bound of the time it takes to perform an algorithm
- Space - the upper bound of how much memory it takes to perform an algorithm
- O(1) - constant complexity; 1 represents any stable complexity
- O(n) - proportionate complexity; the complexity increases proportionately with the size of the enumeration
- O(n^2) - squared complexity; for every element in the enumeration, the complexity increases by the size of the enumeration
- O(n^x) - x complexity; for every element in the enumeration, the complexity increases by the size of the enumeration to the (x-1) power.


## Planned Problems

### Array and String

- Compress - Write a function that takes a string and returns a compressed string by shortening every sequence of the same character to that character followed by the number of repetitions (if any).
- Decompress - Write a function that takes a compressed string decompresses it (Refer to the compress problem).
- Anagrams - Write a function that takes two strings and returns a boolean representing whether the two strings are anagrams of each other.  
	- An anagram of a string is another string that matches the first string in all ways except order of characters.
- Most frequent char - Write a function that takes a string and returns the most frequent char found in the string.
- Pair sum - Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array of all pair sums of the original array.
	- ie. {1, 2, 3} => {1 + 2, 1 + 3, 2 + 3} = {3, 4, 5}
- Pair product - Write a function that takes an array of distinct elements and a number and returns a boolean representing whether the array contains a pair whose product is the number.
